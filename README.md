## Introduction
In recent years, many advances have been made in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. It won't be long before artificial intelligence and its useful (and perhaps destructive) applications will soon appear in our daily lives. Today, its applications can be clearly seen in search engines such as Google, voice assistants of mobile phones, recommender systems of online shopping websites and stores.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning models and techniques help to generally learn patterns in data and also have the ability to **learn from training data**.

In this project, our goal is to teach from basic to advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence. Finally, by learning mathematical concepts and models, the goal is to build programs that can learn from data.
